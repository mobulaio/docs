## Introduction

The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly growing and changing the way we interact with the world around us. However, current blockchain solutions for IoT, such as Helium, have faced several issues and limitations. That's why we're introducing Mobula, a new blockchain where helium left behind.

## Problems with Helium

Helium has faced several issues in recent times. Some users have grown frustrated with the companyâ€™s failure to deliver on its promises. Unlike their motto "People-powered networks", Helium and its hotspot manufacturers failed to bring the network to people. Almost the half of hotspots once joined the network dropped. Remainders barely make any money due to the unstable network and malfunctioning devices. Beyond complaints over low earnings, community members report waiting up to a year for their hotspots to ship.

### Since the transition of Helium network to Solana

There was also news of a major proposal by core developers from Helium to transition the entire Helium network to the Solana blockchain.
This proposal has received mixed reviews, with some pushing back against the switch citing concerns such as downtime issues and questions of how decentralized the Solana blockchain really is. Additionally, there have been reports of issues with a downstream data provider undergoing a migration process that caused Helium Wallet app actions to be degraded. At that time, data in the wallet may have been inaccurate or out of date and transactions may have failed.

## Introducing Mobula

Mobula is a new blockchain designed specifically for IoT. Our team of experienced blockchain developers and IoT experts have come together to create a solution that addresses the problems with Helium and offers a more reliable, scalable, and decentralized solution.

Our blockchain provides faster transaction times, lower fees, and greater security for IoT devices. It's designed to be easy to use and integrate with existing IoT systems, making it simple for businesses and individuals to adopt.

But that's not all. Mobula is built to run on a layer 2 blockchain, providing even greater scalability and efficiency. This allows us to process more transactions at a lower cost while maintaining the security and decentralization of the underlying layer 1 blockchain.

By using Mobula, users will also enjoy a range of benefits. We're offering generous incentives to early adopters, including discounted transaction fees and exclusive access to new features. Plus, our blockchain is designed to provide a better return on investment (ROI) for users, thanks to its efficient design and low operating costs.

## Conclusion

Mobula is the next generation blockchain for IoT. It offers a better alternative to Helium by addressing its problems and providing a more reliable, scalable, and decentralized solution. With faster transaction times, lower fees, and greater security for IoT devices, Mobula is the future of IoT.
